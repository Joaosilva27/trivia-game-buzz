# Buzz! Trivia Game

Inspired by one of my favorite childhood games, Buzz! on the PS2 and PS3, I made this trivia game as a fun tribute. It uses [Google's Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) to generate endless trivia questions, so there’s always something new to play.

The user can pick from the 9 original trivia topics featured in the classic Buzz! games, plus 3 new ones — Pop Culture, Memes, and a custom input. With the custom option, the user can type in any trivia topic they’re interested in, and the AI will generate questions on just about anything they can imagine like Pokémon, the NBA, the 1974 World Cup, marine biology, or literally anything else.

Feel free to play it: [trivia-game-buzz.vercel.app/](https://trivia-game-buzz.vercel.app/)
